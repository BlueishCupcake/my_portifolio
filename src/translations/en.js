    "Hello, my name is Sophie and I'm a trans girl and your friendly (not-so local) maid. \n I have been in touch with tecnology since I was little, mostly by gaming. Around 2020 I finally decided to start working on this habit that I already had and since the beggining I felt a very deep attachment to front-end as it made me possible to create beautiful experiences for users.\n My main interests are: Gaming, Anime, Cosplay and Halloween.",
